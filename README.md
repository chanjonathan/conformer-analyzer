# Conformer Counter
An analysis tool that determines whether substituted cyclohexanes derivative from a Gromacs molecular structure file is in axial or equatorial conformation and determines the total quantity of each.

## Introduction
Gromacs is a widely used molecular dyanmics package that is used to simulate molecular interactions, especially in that of proteins. This tool was intended to help in a project validating the conformation accuracy when simulating substituted cyclohexanes in Gromacs. Specifically, this tool was designed to determine the conformational state of a cyclohexane molecule directly through geometry calculations so that the simulated conformational ratio can be determined and compared to the theoretical ratio.
